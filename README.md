# autoSpeedTbc
Codebase for speed auto equip functionality in WoW Classic TBC

2021.07.26 \\ Creation of develop branch

Issues List \\
- Currently only allows for riding crop auto-equip, needs to allow carrot on a stick as well
- Change logo from autoCarrot logo to something else (like the run icon for rogues?)
- Need switch case and priority for when riding crop, carrot on a stick, mithril spurs, riding skill gloves are present in the bag ==> Riding crop is priority if available
- Occassionally doesn't switch trinket back, not sure why
